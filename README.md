# State Machine

This is the first gold achievements for the Game Programming class in THUAS'
Game Development & Simulation minor.

## Instructions

Implement a state machine without using existing solutions for it.

### Requirements:

- the player should be able to control an object and change its state
- the controls should always be visible on screen
- the controllable object must be a prefab
- implement at least 4 different states that can be uniquely identified
- at least one state must be reliant on another state and can only be entered
when that other state is active
- implement a follow camera so that the object is always in-frame
- make movements framerate-independent

### Submission requirements

- submit a state diagram depicting the different states for the object
- submit a text document containing a description of each state

### Result

*Work in progress*
